## üöÄ Quick Start

### To Understand the Project
1. Read `/prp/PRP_EUROPEANA_CENTRIC_ARCHITECTURE.md` for the complete implementation plan
2. Review `/demo/DEMO_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md` to see what's been built

### To Review the Demo
1. Start with `/demo/DEMO_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md`
2. Test each phase:
   - Input Form: See `/demo/VBVD_FOCUSED_INPUT_FORM.md`
   - Artist Discovery: See `/demo/DEMO_ENHANCEMENTS_EUROPEANA_FIRST.md`
   - Artwork Selection: See `/demo/DEMO_ARTWORKS_ENHANCEMENT.md`

### To Begin Implementation
1. Load `/prp/PRP_EUROPEANA_CENTRIC_ARCHITECTURE.md` into Archon
2. Start with Epic 1: Input Form Redesign
3. Reference `/testing/EUROPEANA_TEST_RESULTS.md` for API patterns

## üéØ Key Concepts

### Europeana-First Architecture
Artworks are discovered FIRST by searching Europeana, then artists are extracted from available artworks. This ensures:
- Every artwork has verified availability
- IIIF quality is guaranteed (95-100%)
- Complete rights information
- Emerging artists are discovered (not just Wikipedia-famous artists)

### Van Bommel van Dam Focus
- Contemporary/modern art only (1920-2025)
- Core media types: Installation, Sculpture, Photography, Mixed Media
- Netherlands default geographic focus
- No historical periods (Renaissance, Baroque, etc.)
